          I was born and raised in Korea until I was ten. Then with my momâ€™s
          keen interest to live abroad, she brought her two sons to live with
          her in Toronto. I attended a small catholic elementary school (Holy
          Redeemer Catholic School), then attended an arts high school (Cardinal
          Carter Academy for the Arts), where I played the clarinet as my
          specialty. Oddly though, this led me to study sciences at McGill
          University.
